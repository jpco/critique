<span class="firstchar">O</span>f all the different ways a person can
be, is it not possible that some of us are, in fact, <i>dogs?</i> This
does not occur to many as possible&mdash;we, as a rule, assume we are
actually humans. But this is an unexplored and implicit assumption,
which has never been held up to the light of rational investigation.
