<span class="firstchar">S</span>o if now, having dismissed your hired impersonators with verdicts
ranging from the laudatory orchid to the disgusted and disgusting
egg, you ask and, of course, notwithstnding the conscious fact of
his irrevocable absence, you instinctively <i>do</i> ask for our so good, so
great, so dead author to stand before the finally lowered curtain and
take his shyly responsible bow for this, his latest, ripest production, it
is I&mdash;my reluctance is, I assure you, co-equal with your dismay&mdash;who
will always loom thus wretchedly into your confused picture,
for, in default of the all-wise, all-explaining master you would speak
<i>to</i>, who else at least can, who else indeed must respond to your bewildered
cry, but its very echo, the begged question you would speak
to him <i>about</i>.

Our native Muse, heaven knows and heaven be praised, is not exclusive.
Whether out of the innocence of a childlike heart to whom all things are pure,
or with the serenity of a status so majestic that the mere keeping up of tones
and appearances, the suburban wonder as to what the strait-laced Unities
might possibly think, or sad sour Probability possibly say, are questions for
which she doesn't because she needn't, she hasn't in her lofty maturity any
longer to care a rap, she invites, dear generous-hearted creature that she is,
just tout le monde to drop in at any time so that her famous, memorable,
sought-after evenings present to the speculative eye an ever-shining, never-tarnished
proof of her amazing unheard-of power to combine and happily
contrast, to make <i>every</i> shade of teh social and moral palette contribute to
the general richness, of the skill, unaproached and unattempted by Grecian
aunt or Gallic sister, with which she can skate full tilt toward the forbidden
incoherence and then, in the last split second, on the shuddering edge of the
bohemian standardless abyss, effect her breathtaking triumphant turn.
